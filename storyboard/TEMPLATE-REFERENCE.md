# Porsche WBT Slide Template Reference

**How to use:**
Give this document to Claude alongside `SLIDE-REFERENCE.md` and a course outline. Claude selects the best template for each slide, writes all required fields, and outputs a complete, parser-ready storyboard block. Every example in this document can be used as a direct model.

**Two template types:**
- **Standard** — fully implemented in `generate-slides.js`. Storyboard fields populate the HTML automatically via the pipeline.
- **Emerging** — custom-built HTML based on a CC03 reference implementation. Write the storyboard block the same way; HTML is built by hand and customized with the slide's content. These will be promoted to Standard as the template library grows.

## Standard Templates

---

### `hero-title`

**Status:** Standard — parser-generated
**Use when:** Opening every module. Always Slide 01. No exceptions.
**Avoid when:** Any position other than Slide 01.

**What the learner sees:**
Full-bleed background image with dark gradient overlay. Left-aligned: small module eyebrow label, red accent bar (120px × 8px), large module title, subtitle line below. Title fades in at 0.5s. Optional Lottie underline animation on the title.

**Required fields:**

| Field | Format | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `Slide-Title` | Module title text | Main hero heading |
| `Image-File` | `descriptive_name_CCxx.webp` | Full-bleed background — premium, aspirational |
| `Hero-Subtitle` | e.g. `Module 3 of 12` | Caption line below the title |
| `Voiceover-INTRO` | 3–5 sentences | Welcome + module purpose + what learner will gain |
| `Caption-Text` | ≤120 chars | First sentence of INTRO VO |

**Optional fields:**

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| `Image` | Art direction if `Image-File` is not yet sourced |

**Interaction model:**
- Next unlocks on slide load — no interaction lock.
- VO plays on entry. No other interactions.

**VO guidance:**
Open with the module name and number. State what the learner will gain. End with energy — this sets the tone for the entire module. Do not list objectives here (that is the next slide's job).

**Example:**
```
## Slide 01 — Module Title

Slide-ID: SLD_CC00_001
Template-ID: hero-title
Slide-Title: The Art of Communication
Image-File: porsche_advisor_greeting_CC00.webp
Hero-Subtitle: Module 3 of 12
>> On slide load → SLD_CC00_001_INTRO.mp3
Voiceover-INTRO: Welcome to Module 3 — The Art of Communication. In every service interaction, the words you choose, the way you listen, and the energy you bring determine whether a customer leaves satisfied — or simply leaves. In this module, you'll learn the communication skills that set Porsche service professionals apart from the rest.
Caption-Text: Welcome to Module 3 — The Art of Communication.
Image: Wide shot of a Porsche service advisor engaged in warm conversation with a customer at a service desk. Professional, attentive, premium environment. Porsche branding visible in background.
Status: Draft
Notes: hero-title chosen — standard module opener. Hero image should reinforce the communication theme.
```

---

### `objectives`

**Status:** Standard — parser-generated
**Use when:** Slide 02 of every module. Always second. No exceptions.
**Avoid when:** Any position other than Slide 02.

**What the learner sees:**
Two-column layout: section heading on the left, numbered learning objectives on the right that animate in sequentially. All objectives must be visible before Next unlocks.

**Required fields:**

| Field | Format | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `Slide-Title` | e.g. `In this module, you will:` | Left column heading |
| `Objective-1` through `Objective-N` | Verb-first: `Identify…`, `Explain…`, `Apply…` | One complete objective per field. Parser stops at first missing number. Max 10. |
| `Voiceover-INTRO` | 1 intro + 1 sentence per objective | VO names each objective aloud so animation timing aligns |
| `Caption-Text` | ≤120 chars | e.g. `By the end of this module, you will be able to do four things.` |

**Interaction model:**
- Next locks on entry until all objectives have animated in.
- Objectives animate in sequentially — each fades in as the VO names it.
- No click interaction required.

**VO guidance:**
One sentence stating the total count ("By the end of this module, you will be able to do four things."), then one sentence per objective. Each objective sentence should closely echo the `Objective-N` field text so the animation timing aligns naturally.

**Example:**
```
## Slide 02 — Learning Objectives

Slide-ID: SLD_CC00_002
Template-ID: objectives
Slide-Title: In this module, you will:
Objective-1: Explain why communication breaks down in service interactions
Objective-2: Identify the four active listening techniques used by top advisors
Objective-3: Apply the FACE framework to your next customer conversation
Objective-4: Recognize common barriers to listening and how to overcome them
>> On slide load → SLD_CC00_002_INTRO.mp3
Voiceover-INTRO: By the end of this module, you will be able to do four things. First — explain why communication breaks down even when both parties are trying. Second — identify the four active listening techniques used by the most effective Porsche service advisors. Third — apply the FACE framework in your next customer conversation. And fourth — recognize the most common barriers to listening and know what to do about them.
Caption-Text: By the end of this module, you will be able to do four things.
Status: Draft
Notes: objectives chosen — standard second slide. VO explicitly names each objective so stagger animations sync naturally to audio.
```

---

### `content-split`

**Status:** Standard — parser-generated
**Use when:** Presenting a single instructional concept — one main idea with supporting context. Most common content slide type.
**Avoid when:** Content is a list (use `content-bullets`), a key statistic (use `content-stat`), needs interaction (use `card-explore` or `tile-explore`), or is a leadership quote (use `content-quote`).

**What the learner sees:**
Two-column layout: text on the left (heading, red accent bar, body paragraph OR a Pull-Quote), image on the right. Entrance animations stagger left to right on load.

**Required fields:**

| Field | Format | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `Slide-Title` | Section heading | Displayed above body copy |
| `On-Screen-Text` | 1–3 sentence paragraph | Body copy. Do not combine with `Pull-Quote`. |
| `Image-File` | `descriptive_name_CCxx.webp` | Right-column image |
| `Voiceover-INTRO` | 4–7 sentences | Expand on the on-screen content — never repeat it verbatim |
| `Caption-Text` | ≤120 chars | First sentence of INTRO VO |

**Optional fields:**

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| `Pull-Quote` | Replaces `On-Screen-Text` with a large styled key-point statement. One sentence. Use when the slide carries a single defining idea that should land visually. **Never use both** `Pull-Quote` and `On-Screen-Text` — if both are present, `Pull-Quote` takes priority. |
| `Image` | Art direction if `Image-File` is not yet sourced |

**Interaction model:**
- No interaction locks. Content animates in on load. Next available immediately.

**VO guidance:**
4–7 sentences. Open by contextualizing the on-screen text, then expand with supporting detail, examples, or implications. End with a bridge sentence toward the next slide. Do not read the on-screen text verbatim.

**Example — body copy:**
```
## Slide 04 — Why Communication Fails

Slide-ID: SLD_CC00_004
Template-ID: content-split
Slide-Title: Why Communication Fails
On-Screen-Text: Communication breaks down not because people aren't trying — but because most conversations are built on assumptions about what the other person already understands.
Image-File: crossed_signals_CC00.webp
>> On slide load → SLD_CC00_004_INTRO.mp3
Voiceover-INTRO: Here's the paradox of communication failures — they almost never happen because people stop trying. They happen because both parties assume they're already aligned. In a service context, you might assume the customer knows what a specific repair involves. They assume you know exactly what they mean by "it feels off." Those assumptions stack, and suddenly a simple service appointment becomes a complaint. Closing that gap is what this module is about.
Caption-Text: Communication breaks down not because people aren't trying.
Image: Stylized concept image — two people in conversation, each looking in slightly different directions. Minimal, premium design aesthetic.
Status: Draft
Notes: content-split chosen — single concept, body copy carries the full idea.
```

**Example — Pull-Quote:**
```
## Slide 05 — The First Impression Window

Slide-ID: SLD_CC00_005
Template-ID: content-split
Slide-Title: The First Impression Window
Pull-Quote: You have about seven seconds to establish trust — after that, the customer has already decided how they feel about you.
Image-File: advisor_greeting_CC00.webp
>> On slide load → SLD_CC00_005_INTRO.mp3
Voiceover-INTRO: Research on first impressions consistently points to a seven-second window. In those seven seconds, a customer has already formed a judgment about whether you're trustworthy, whether you listen, and whether they'll be comfortable with you managing their vehicle. You can recover from a weak first impression — but it takes the rest of the appointment to do it. Getting it right from the start is always worth the effort.
Caption-Text: You have about seven seconds to establish trust.
Image: Porsche service advisor greeting a customer at the service bay entrance. Confident, warm expression. Good posture. Premium service environment.
Status: Draft
Notes: content-split with Pull-Quote chosen — single defining insight. Quote makes it land visually; VO carries the supporting reasoning.
```

---

### `content-stat`

**Status:** Standard — parser-generated
**Use when:** A single number, percentage, or ratio is the central point of the slide.
**Avoid when:** You have multiple statistics (use `content-split` with body copy) or the stat needs interactive exploration.

**What the learner sees:**
Split layout: intro paragraph on the left, large highlighted statistic on the right (value displayed large, label displayed beneath). Dramatic visual weight on the number.

**`On-Screen-Text` format — `VALUE Label`:**
Parser splits on the first space. Everything before the first space becomes the large stat value; everything after becomes the label below it.
- `94% Customer Satisfaction Score`
- `7 Seconds to Make a First Impression`
- `3× More Likely to Return`

**Required fields:**

| Field | Format | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `Slide-Title` | Section heading | |
| `On-Screen-Text` | `VALUE Label` | First token = large stat; remainder = label |
| `Voiceover-INTRO` | 4–6 sentences | State the number, then contextualize — what it means, why it matters in practice |
| `Caption-Text` | ≤120 chars | First sentence of INTRO VO |

**Interaction model:**
- No interaction locks. Stat animates in on load.

**VO guidance:**
State the number first. Spend 3–4 sentences on what it means in daily practice. Don't just restate the label — connect it to behavior.

**Example:**
```
## Slide 06 — What the Data Says

Slide-ID: SLD_CC00_006
Template-ID: content-stat
Slide-Title: What the Data Says
On-Screen-Text: 55% of Communication Is Nonverbal
>> On slide load → SLD_CC00_006_INTRO.mp3
Voiceover-INTRO: Fifty-five percent. That's the share of your message carried by body language alone — before a single word is considered. Add tone of voice, and you're at over ninety percent before the content of what you say even registers. This matters because it means the most important parts of your communication happen before you open your mouth. Your posture when you approach, your eye contact when you listen, your expression when you deliver news — all of it speaks louder than the words.
Caption-Text: Fifty-five percent of communication is carried by body language alone.
Status: Draft
Notes: content-stat chosen — the 55% figure anchors the nonverbal communication section. Stat value: 55%, label: "of Communication Is Nonverbal".
```

---

### `content-bullets`

**Status:** Standard — parser-generated
**Use when:** Presenting a list of 3–6 parallel items — principles, considerations, or components where order doesn't matter.
**Avoid when:** Items have a required sequence (use `step-sequence`), items need individual deep-dive interaction (use `card-explore`), or there are more than 6 items.

**What the learner sees:**
Split layout: brief intro paragraph above a bulleted list on the left, image on the right. The generator creates HTML scaffold with `<!-- Bullet heading -->` and `<!-- Supporting detail -->` placeholder comments — these must be filled in manually after running the generator.

**Required fields:**

| Field | Format | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `Slide-Title` | Section heading | |
| `On-Screen-Text` | 1–2 sentence intro | Sets up the list |
| `Image-File` | `descriptive_name_CCxx.webp` | Right-column image |
| `Voiceover-INTRO` | 4–7 sentences | Walk through each bullet with one sentence each |
| `Caption-Text` | ≤120 chars | First sentence of INTRO VO |

**Post-generation step required:** After running `generate-slides.js`, open the HTML file and fill in the `<!-- Bullet heading -->` and `<!-- Supporting detail -->` placeholder comments in the generated bullet list.

**VO guidance:**
One intro sentence, then one sentence per bullet. Keep each bullet explanation tight — one clear idea per item.

**Example:**
```
## Slide 08 — The FACE Framework

Slide-ID: SLD_CC00_008
Template-ID: content-bullets
Slide-Title: The FACE Framework
On-Screen-Text: Top Porsche service advisors structure every intake conversation using four steps.
Image-File: face_framework_overview_CC00.webp
>> On slide load → SLD_CC00_008_INTRO.mp3
Voiceover-INTRO: The FACE framework gives every intake conversation a reliable structure. Focus — start the interaction with your full, undivided attention on the customer. Acknowledge — confirm what they've told you before moving forward. Clarify — ask the one follow-up question that fills in the biggest gap. And Explore — look beyond the reported concern to anything else that may need attention. Use these four steps in sequence, and you'll rarely leave a customer feeling unheard.
Caption-Text: Top Porsche service advisors structure every intake using four steps.
Image: Clean graphic or illustration of the four FACE steps — minimal, branded, on dark background.
Status: Draft
Notes: content-bullets chosen — four parallel framework components. Fill in bullet headings and detail in generated HTML after running the generator.
```

---

### `content-quote`

**Status:** Standard — parser-generated
**Use when:** Delivering a brand philosophy statement, leadership quote, or memorable customer insight. Use to create an emotional beat between instructional sections.
**Avoid when:** The content is instructional rather than inspirational, or the slide needs to present multiple ideas.

**What the learner sees:**
Full-bleed atmospheric image as background. Large quote text on the left with a red accent bar, attribution name, and role beneath. Dark gradient overlay ensures text legibility over the image.

**Required fields:**

| Field | Format | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `Quote` | The quoted text | Keep ≤25 words for visual impact |
| `Quote-Attribution` | Speaker name | First and last name |
| `Quote-Title` | Role or context | e.g. `Director of Customer Experience, Porsche Cars North America` |
| `Image-File` | `descriptive_name_CCxx.webp` | Full-bleed background — cinematic, atmospheric |
| `Voiceover-INTRO` | 4–6 sentences | Read the quote first, then contextualize it |
| `Caption-Text` | ≤120 chars | The quote text itself (first sentence) |

**Interaction model:**
- No interaction locks. Content appears on load.

**VO guidance:**
Open by reading the quote naturally (with quotation marks in delivery). Then spend 3–4 sentences on what it means for the learner's specific daily work. Make it personal and concrete.

**Example:**
```
## Slide 09 — Brand Principle

Slide-ID: SLD_CC00_009
Template-ID: content-quote
Quote: The customer doesn't remember what you fixed — they remember how you made them feel.
Quote-Attribution: Tara Reyes
Quote-Title: Director of Customer Experience, Porsche Cars North America
Image-File: porsche_mountain_road_CC00.webp
>> On slide load → SLD_CC00_009_INTRO.mp3
Voiceover-INTRO: "The customer doesn't remember what you fixed — they remember how you made them feel." This insight captures something essential about the Porsche service experience. The technical work is the baseline — it's expected. What separates great Porsche advisors is the human layer on top of it. The tone of voice, the follow-up call, the way you delivered difficult news — that's what the customer carries with them.
Caption-Text: The customer doesn't remember what you fixed — they remember how you made them feel.
Image: Dramatic wide shot of a Porsche 911 on an empty mountain road at dusk. Cinematic, golden hour light. Minimal — no people. Sense of journey.
Status: Draft
Notes: content-quote chosen — brand philosophy statement. Creates an emotional beat between technical content sections.
```

---

### `card-explore`

**Status:** Standard — parser-generated
**Use when:** Presenting 3–6 parallel concepts of roughly equal weight where active individual exploration is the goal.
**Avoid when:** Content is sequential (use `step-sequence`), items have poster images (use `tile-explore`), or there are more than 6 items.

**What the learner sees:**
Section heading above a grid of 3–6 cards. Cards are locked (grayed out with a shimmer) on entry. After the INTRO VO ends, cards unlock. Clicking a card plays its VO. Next button locks until all cards have been visited.

**Card label format:** PascalCase, no spaces — `ServiceQuality`, `ActiveListening`, `BodyLanguage`

**Required fields:**

| Field | Format | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `Slide-Title` | Section heading | |
| `Voiceover-INTRO` | 2–3 sentences | Name the topic; state the number of cards; end with instruction to click each one |
| `Voiceover-CLICK-Label` | One per card, 2–4 sentences each | Label becomes card title. PascalCase. Plays on card click. |
| `Caption-Text` | ≤120 chars | First sentence of INTRO VO |

**Optional fields:**

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| `Image` | Art direction for background image if applicable |

**Audio file naming (auto-generated):** `{SLIDE_ID}_CLICK_{Label}.mp3`

**Interaction model:**
- Cards locked until INTRO VO ends.
- Card click → card content reveals + CLICK audio plays.
- Next locked until all cards visited.

**VO guidance:**
- INTRO (2–3 sentences): Name the topic and card count. End with a clear instruction to click each card.
- CLICK per card (2–4 sentences): Cover that concept directly and specifically. Don't introduce new concepts here.

**Example:**
```
## Slide 11 — The Three Channels of Communication

Slide-ID: SLD_CC00_011
Template-ID: card-explore
Slide-Title: The Three Channels of Communication
>> On slide load → SLD_CC00_011_INTRO.mp3
Voiceover-INTRO: Every message you send travels through three channels simultaneously. Understanding each one gives you more control over how you're perceived. Click each card to explore the three channels.
Caption-Text: Every message you send travels through three channels simultaneously.
>> User clicks BodyLanguage card → SLD_CC00_011_CLICK_BodyLanguage.mp3
Voiceover-CLICK-BodyLanguage: Body language carries more of your message than most people realize — posture, eye contact, facial expression, and proximity all communicate before you speak. In a service interaction, an open stance and steady eye contact signal confidence and engagement. A glance at your screen or crossed arms signal the opposite, even when that's not your intent.
>> User clicks ToneOfVoice card → SLD_CC00_011_CLICK_ToneOfVoice.mp3
Voiceover-CLICK-ToneOfVoice: Your tone of voice — warmth, pace, and confidence — shapes how your message lands more than word choice does. The same sentence delivered with certainty builds trust; delivered with hesitation creates doubt. Slow down when delivering difficult news. Let your tone match the content.
>> User clicks Words card → SLD_CC00_011_CLICK_Words.mp3
Voiceover-CLICK-Words: The words you choose matter — but they carry less weight than most people assume. Where words matter most is in precision and ownership. "I will take care of that" lands differently than "someone will handle it." Specific, first-person language signals accountability.
Image: Clean minimal illustration of three overlapping signal rings — representing the three communication channels.
Status: Draft
Notes: card-explore chosen — three parallel, equally weighted concepts. Each requires individual exploration before the learner can move on.
```

---

### `knowledge-check`

**Status:** Standard — parser-generated
**Use when:** Testing comprehension at a natural topic boundary — after every 3–4 content slides throughout the module.
**Avoid when:** Testing end-of-module learning objectives (use `final-quiz`).

**What the learner sees:**
Centered modal card on a dimmed, patterned backdrop. Red accent header with slide title. Question stem. Four lettered options (A–D) as rows. Submit button disabled until an answer is selected. Wrong answer: options dim, "Back to Review" button appears. Correct answer: feedback strip reveals, Next unlocks.

**Required fields:**

| Field | Format | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `Question` | Full question stem | Test understanding or application — not verbatim recall |
| `Choice-1` through `Choice-4` | One choice per field | All distractors must be plausible |
| `Correct-Answer` | Number 1–4 | Corresponds to the correct `Choice-N` |
| `Review-Slide` | `SLD_CCxx_NNN` | Slide to return to on wrong answer — the most relevant content slide |
| `Voiceover-INTRO` | Standard 2-sentence prompt | Always: `Let's check your understanding. Select the best answer.` |
| `Caption-Text` | ≤120 chars | Always: `Let's check your understanding.` |

**Interaction model:**
- Next locked on entry.
- Wrong answer → all options dim → "Back to Review" button → learner returns to `Review-Slide`.
- Correct answer → feedback strip reveals → Next unlocks.
- No `Voiceover-CLICK-*` fields — no VO plays on answer selection.

**Writing strong questions:**
- One clearly correct answer; three plausible distractors based on real misconceptions.
- Question tests application of understanding, not recall of a specific word or number.
- `Review-Slide` points to the slide that most directly answers the question.

**Example:**
```
## Slide 12 — Knowledge Check 1

Slide-ID: KC_CC00_001
Template-ID: knowledge-check
Slide-Title: Knowledge Check
Question: Which channel of communication carries the largest share of how a message is received?
Choice-1: The specific words chosen
Choice-2: The technical accuracy of the information
Choice-3: Body language and nonverbal cues
Choice-4: The speed of delivery
Correct-Answer: 3
Review-Slide: SLD_CC00_006
>> On slide load → KC_CC00_001_INTRO.mp3
Voiceover-INTRO: Let's check your understanding. Select the best answer.
Caption-Text: Let's check your understanding.
Status: Draft
Notes: knowledge-check chosen — tests the core concept from the communication channels section. Review-Slide points to the content-stat slide with the 55% nonverbal figure.
```

---

### `final-quiz`

**Status:** Standard — parser-generated
**Use when:** End-of-module scored assessment — one question per learning objective, placed after the `closing` slide.
**Avoid when:** Mid-module comprehension checks (use `knowledge-check`).

**What the learner sees:**
Same modal layout as `knowledge-check`. No review loop — after submitting, the learner advances to the next question automatically. All results reported to SCORM.

**Required fields:**

| Field | Format | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `Question` | Full question stem | |
| `Choice-1` through `Choice-4` | One choice per field | |
| `Correct-Answer` | Number 1–4 | |
| `Voiceover-INTRO` | Short prompt | `Question one. Choose the best answer.` / `Question two. Choose the best answer.` etc. |
| `Caption-Text` | ≤120 chars | Same as VO prompt |

**No `Review-Slide` field.** Final quiz questions do not have a review loop.

**Interaction model:**
- Next locked. Answer + submit → learner advances to next question automatically.
- Results tallied across all `final-quiz` slides; reported by the `quiz-score` slide.

**Example:**
```
## Slide 17 — Final Quiz Question 1

Slide-ID: FQ_CC00_001
Template-ID: final-quiz
Slide-Title: Final Assessment — Question 1
Question: According to the FACE framework, what should you do immediately after a customer explains their concern?
Choice-1: Open the work order and begin documenting
Choice-2: Ask how long they've had the vehicle
Choice-3: Acknowledge what they said and reflect it back
Choice-4: Explain the likely cause and estimated cost
Correct-Answer: 3
>> On slide load → FQ_CC00_001_INTRO.mp3
Voiceover-INTRO: Question one. Choose the best answer.
Caption-Text: Question one. Choose the best answer.
Status: Draft
Notes: final-quiz chosen — tests Objective 3 (apply the FACE framework). Distractors are all plausible service advisor actions.
```

---

### `quiz-score`

**Status:** Standard — parser-generated
**Use when:** Final slide of every module — always after all `final-quiz` slides.
**Avoid when:** Any other position.

**What the learner sees:**
Animated score ring (circular fill) showing the learner's percentage. Pass (≥ 80%) or fail badge with congratulations or encouragement message. SCORM reporting triggered automatically on display.

**Required fields:** Only `Slide-ID` and `Slide-Title`. Do not add any content fields — the slide is fully dynamic.

**Interaction model:** None. Slide reads results from the SCORM runtime and displays them.

**Example:**
```
## Slide 20 — Quiz Score

Slide-ID: FQ_CC00_SCORE
Template-ID: quiz-score
Slide-Title: Module 3 Assessment Results
Status: Draft
Notes: quiz-score chosen — required final slide. Pass threshold 80%. SCORM reporting is automatic. No content fields needed.
```

---

### `closing`

**Status:** Standard — parser-generated
**Use when:** Module wrap-up — always the last content slide before the `final-quiz` sequence begins.
**Avoid when:** Any position other than just before the final quiz slides.

**What the learner sees:**
Module wrap-up layout with heading, brief summary message, optional accent image. Clean and minimal — designed to transition the learner from content into assessment mode.

**Required fields:**

| Field | Format | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `Slide-Title` | e.g. `Module Complete` or `Well Done` | Closing heading |
| `On-Screen-Text` | 1–2 sentence summary | What the learner has accomplished |
| `Image-File` | `descriptive_name_CCxx.webp` | Accent image — optional but recommended |
| `Voiceover-INTRO` | 3–5 sentences | Brief summary + clear transition to the assessment |
| `Caption-Text` | ≤120 chars | First sentence of INTRO VO |

**VO guidance:**
Acknowledge what was covered in the module. Reinforce the single most important takeaway. Transition clearly to the assessment: "In the next section, you'll complete a short assessment to confirm your understanding."

**Example:**
```
## Slide 16 — Module Closing

Slide-ID: SLD_CC00_016
Template-ID: closing
Slide-Title: Module Complete
On-Screen-Text: You've explored the communication skills that separate good service from great service — and learned how to apply them in every customer interaction.
Image-File: porsche_handshake_closing_CC00.webp
>> On slide load → SLD_CC00_016_INTRO.mp3
Voiceover-INTRO: You've covered a lot of ground in this module. You now understand why communication breaks down, how the three channels shape every message you send, and how to use the FACE framework to structure every intake conversation. In the next section, you'll complete a short assessment to confirm your understanding. Take your time and trust what you've learned.
Caption-Text: You've explored the communication skills that separate good service from great service.
Image: Warm, premium wide shot of a Porsche service advisor and customer walking together. Both in motion — forward momentum. Premium service environment.
Status: Draft
Notes: closing chosen — standard module wrap-up. VO transitions clearly to the assessment.
```

## Emerging Templates

These templates are implemented as custom HTML in the CC03 module. Write the storyboard block exactly as shown — the HTML is built by hand using the reference implementation as a base and customized with the slide's content. They follow the same field conventions as standard templates.

As each template is tightened and made fully general, it will be promoted to Standard.

---

### `tile-explore`

**Status:** Emerging — reference implementations: `SLD_CC03_004.html`, `SLD_CC03_012.html`
**Use when:** Presenting 3–5 parallel topics where each has a distinct visual identity (poster image) and detailed content (title, description, bullets). Visually richer than `card-explore`.
**Avoid when:** Topics don't have distinct visual identities (use `card-explore`), there are more than 5 tiles (layout breaks), or the depth per topic doesn't justify the tile format.

**What the learner sees:**
Horizontal row of 3–5 tiles. Each tile shows a full-bleed poster image at rest. On click, the selected tile expands and reveals a title, description, and bullet list while other tiles compress. Tiles are locked until INTRO VO ends. All tiles must be visited before Next unlocks.

**Card label format:** PascalCase, no spaces — same convention as `card-explore`.

**Required fields:**

| Field | Format | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `Slide-Title` | Section heading | Displayed above the tile row |
| `Voiceover-INTRO` | 2–3 sentences | Name the topic and tile count; end with instruction to explore each |
| `Voiceover-CLICK-Label` | One per tile, 2–4 sentences | Plays when tile expands. Label = tile title in PascalCase |
| `Caption-Text` | ≤120 chars | First sentence of INTRO VO |
| `Image` | Art direction per tile | Describe each tile's poster image in the `Notes` field or as `Image-[Label]` fields |

**Audio file naming:** `{SLIDE_ID}_CLICK_{Label}.mp3`

**Interaction model:**
- Tiles locked until INTRO VO ends.
- Click → tile expands + CLICK audio plays.
- Next locked until all tiles visited.

**VO guidance:**
- INTRO (2–3 sentences): Name the concept category and count. End with explicit instruction to explore.
- CLICK per tile (2–4 sentences): Deliver substantive, specific content for that tile. Direct and concrete.

**Example:**

## Slide 10 — Three Pillars of Active Listening

Slide-ID: SLD_CC00_010
Template-ID: tile-explore
Slide-Title: Three Pillars of Active Listening
>> On slide load → SLD_CC00_010_INTRO.mp3
Voiceover-INTRO: Active listening rests on three pillars that work together to make a customer feel genuinely heard. Explore each tile to understand what each one looks like in practice.
Caption-Text: Active listening rests on three pillars that work together.
>> User clicks Presence tile → SLD_CC00_010_CLICK_Presence.mp3
Voiceover-CLICK-Presence: Presence means giving the customer your full, undivided attention — not split attention between the screen and the conversation. Put the keyboard down. Make eye contact. Let silence happen when they're thinking. Customers can feel when they have all of you, and when they only have part of you.
>> User clicks Reflection tile → SLD_CC00_010_CLICK_Reflection.mp3
Voiceover-CLICK-Reflection: Reflection is the act of paraphrasing what the customer said before you respond. It's not just repeating their words — it's showing that you processed them. "So what you're noticing is..." confirms you heard correctly and gives them a chance to clarify anything before the conversation moves forward.
>> User clicks Curiosity tile → SLD_CC00_010_CLICK_Curiosity.mp3
Voiceover-CLICK-Curiosity: Curiosity means asking one more question when you think you already understand. The concern a customer describes first is often not the full picture. "Is there anything else you've noticed?" opens the conversation and frequently surfaces issues that would have been missed if you'd moved straight to the work order.
Image-Presence: Advisor making full eye contact with a customer, no device in hand. Focused and warm.
Image-Reflection: Advisor nodding attentively while customer speaks, pen down.
Image-Curiosity: Advisor with open posture, leaning slightly forward, asking a follow-up question.
Status: Draft
Notes: tile-explore chosen — three visually distinct pillars with substantive per-tile detail. Reference implementation: SLD_CC03_004.html.

### `tab-panel`

**Status:** Emerging — reference implementation: `SLD_CC03_009.html`
**Use when:** Presenting 3–5 named techniques or topics where the learner can explore in any order and doesn't need to visit all tabs.
**Avoid when:** All topics must be visited (use `tile-explore` or `card-explore`), there are more than 5 tabs, or the content is sequential (use `step-sequence`).

**What the learner sees:**
Left panel with stacked tab navigation buttons. Right side shows an image that updates per selected tab. Clicking a tab swaps the content area and plays the tab's VO. Tabs are locked until INTRO VO ends. Next unlocks after the first tab is clicked — visiting all tabs is not required.

**Tab label format:** PascalCase, no spaces — `Paraphrase`, `Clarify`, `PerceptionCheck`, `Summarize`

**Required fields:**

| Field | Format | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `Slide-Title` | Section heading | Left panel heading |
| `Voiceover-INTRO` | 2–3 sentences | Name the topic and tab count; invite exploration |
| `Voiceover-TAB-Label` | One per tab, 2–4 sentences | Plays when tab is opened. Label = tab name in PascalCase |
| `Image-File` | `descriptive_name_CCxx.webp` | Default/first-tab image |
| `Caption-Text` | ≤120 chars | First sentence of INTRO VO |

**Audio file naming:** `{SLIDE_ID}_TAB_{Label}.mp3`

**Interaction model:**
- Tabs locked until INTRO VO ends.
- Tab click → content area updates + TAB audio plays.
- Next unlocks after the first tab click. Visiting all tabs is not required.

**VO guidance:**
- INTRO (2–3 sentences): Name the concept and count of techniques. Invite exploration.
- TAB per tab (2–4 sentences): Cover the technique with a practical, specific example.

**Example:**
```
## Slide 13 — Active Listening Techniques

Slide-ID: SLD_CC00_013
Template-ID: tab-panel
Slide-Title: Active Listening Techniques
>> On slide load → SLD_CC00_013_INTRO.mp3
Voiceover-INTRO: There are four active listening techniques that top Porsche service advisors use consistently. Explore each tab to understand how and when to apply it.
Caption-Text: There are four active listening techniques top Porsche advisors use consistently.
Image-File: advisor_listening_CC00.webp
>> User opens Paraphrase tab → SLD_CC00_013_TAB_Paraphrase.mp3
Voiceover-TAB-Paraphrase: Paraphrasing is restating what the customer said in your own words — "So what I'm hearing is that the noise happens mostly at highway speeds, especially when you accelerate. Is that right?" It confirms understanding, gives the customer a chance to correct anything, and signals that you were fully listening. Use it before you start writing the work order.
>> User opens Clarify tab → SLD_CC00_013_TAB_Clarify.mp3
Voiceover-TAB-Clarify: Clarifying questions fill in the gaps before they become problems. "When you say it feels off — is that more of a vibration, or more of a pull?" gets to the specific symptom before you've committed to a diagnosis. One precise clarifying question saves more time than three hours of rework.
>> User opens PerceptionCheck tab → SLD_CC00_013_TAB_PerceptionCheck.mp3
Voiceover-TAB-PerceptionCheck: A perception check confirms you've read the customer's emotional state correctly. "You seem a little uncertain about whether this is worth addressing now — does that sound right?" It opens space for a concern the customer might not have volunteered on their own. Done well, it builds trust immediately.
>> User opens Summarize tab → SLD_CC00_013_TAB_Summarize.mp3
Voiceover-TAB-Summarize: Summarizing brings the intake conversation to a clear close — "So here's what we're going to look at today..." followed by everything you heard. It reduces miscommunication before work begins, gives the customer confidence that nothing was missed, and creates a natural transition to the work order.
Status: Draft
Notes: tab-panel chosen — four techniques of equal weight; learner doesn't need to visit all. Reference implementation: SLD_CC03_009.html.
```

### `step-sequence`

**Status:** Emerging — reference implementations: `SLD_CC03_007.html`, `SLD_CC03_014.html`
**Use when:** Content has a clear required order — steps in a process, phases of a framework, or a procedure where sequence matters.
**Avoid when:** Steps are parallel or unordered (use `card-explore` or `tile-explore`).

**What the learner sees:**
Step cards presented in sequence. Each step has a number, title, description, and optional bullets. A Next Step button advances to the next card. Each step's audio must complete before the Next Step button activates. All steps must be completed before the slide's main Next button unlocks.

**`Voiceover-STEP-N` naming:** Always zero-padded to 2 digits — `Voiceover-STEP-01`, `Voiceover-STEP-02`, etc.

**Required fields:**

| Field | Format | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `Slide-Title` | Section heading | |
| `Voiceover-INTRO` | 2–3 sentences | Set up the sequence; name the framework and step count; tell learner to use the button to advance |
| `Voiceover-STEP-01` through `Voiceover-STEP-N` | One per step, 2–4 sentences | Zero-padded. Plays when that step card activates. |
| `Caption-Text` | ≤120 chars | First sentence of INTRO VO |

**Audio file naming:** `{SLIDE_ID}_STEP_{N}.mp3` (e.g. `SLD_CC00_014_STEP_1.mp3`)

**Interaction model:**
- INTRO VO plays on load. First step locked until INTRO VO ends.
- Step activates on button click. Step VO plays.
- Next Step button disabled until that step's VO ends.
- All steps must be completed. Slide Next button unlocks after final step VO ends.

**VO guidance:**
- INTRO (2–3 sentences): Name the framework and step count. Tell the learner to use the button to advance when ready.
- STEP per step (2–4 sentences): Explain the step concretely. Use a brief real-world example if it fits in the sentence count.

**Example:**
```
## Slide 14 — The FACE Framework in Action

Slide-ID: SLD_CC00_014
Template-ID: step-sequence
Slide-Title: The FACE Framework in Action
>> On slide load → SLD_CC00_014_INTRO.mp3
Voiceover-INTRO: Let's walk through the FACE framework one step at a time. Each step builds on the last. Use the arrow to advance when you're ready.
Caption-Text: Let's walk through the FACE framework one step at a time.
>> Step 1 activates → SLD_CC00_014_STEP_1.mp3
Voiceover-STEP-01: Focus. Before the customer says a single word, your attention tells them everything. Put the tablet to the side. Make eye contact. Greet them by name if you have it. A customer who feels like the most important person in the room in those first ten seconds carries that feeling through the entire visit.
>> Step 2 activates → SLD_CC00_014_STEP_2.mp3
Voiceover-STEP-02: Acknowledge. After the customer explains their concern, say it back to them in your own words. Not to repeat it — to confirm you heard it. "So the vibration started about two weeks ago and it's getting more noticeable — is that right?" This one step eliminates more miscommunication than any other.
>> Step 3 activates → SLD_CC00_014_STEP_3.mp3
Voiceover-STEP-03: Clarify. Ask the one question that fills in the biggest gap. Not five questions — one. "Does it happen at all speeds, or mostly above fifty miles per hour?" gets you to the specific symptom without overwhelming the customer. Write the work order only after you've clarified.
>> Step 4 activates → SLD_CC00_014_STEP_4.mp3
Voiceover-STEP-04: Explore. Before you close the intake, ask one open-door question — "Is there anything else you've noticed, or anything else I can help you with today?" This is where deferred maintenance and additional concerns surface. It's also the moment that makes a customer feel genuinely cared for rather than processed.
Status: Draft
Notes: step-sequence chosen — FACE framework has a required order; all four steps must be completed. Reference implementation: SLD_CC03_007.html.
```

### `video-scenario`

**Status:** Emerging — reference implementation: `SLD_CC03_008.html`
**Use when:** A video scenario demonstrates a concept better than text — skill application in a real conversation, a before/after comparison, or a situation the learner must evaluate.
**Avoid when:** The video is purely illustrative with no interaction needed (use `content-split` with a `Video-File` field).

**What the learner sees:**
Slide header bar (accent dot, label, title). Intro overlay with play button — locked until INTRO VO ends. Video plays in a centered 16:9 player. Optional pause-point questions stop the video and overlay a multiple-choice card. Summary overlay plays after the video ends. Next unlocks after the summary VO completes.

**Required fields:**

| Field | Format | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `Slide-Title` | Section heading | Displayed in the header bar |
| `Video-File` | `filename_CCxx.mp4` | Video file. Dual-clip: two filenames comma-separated. |
| `Voiceover-INTRO` | 2–3 sentences | Plays over the intro overlay before the video starts |
| `Caption-Text` | ≤120 chars | First sentence of INTRO VO |

**Optional fields:**

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| `Voiceover-Summary` | 2–3 sentences. Plays after video ends, before Next unlocks. |
| `Pause-Question-N` | Pause-point quiz format: `TIMESTAMP \| Question \| A. Option \| B. Option \| C. Option \| D. Option \| Correct: A` |

**Interaction model:**
- INTRO VO plays; play button locked until INTRO VO ends.
- Learner clicks play; video starts.
- Pause-point questions (if present) stop the video; learner must answer before video resumes.
- Summary VO plays after video ends.
- Next unlocks after summary VO completes.

**VO guidance:**
- INTRO (2–3 sentences): Set up the scenario. Tell the learner what to watch for. Do not reveal the outcome.
- Summary (2–3 sentences): Reflect on what was demonstrated. Connect it to the module's lesson.

**Example:**
```
## Slide 15 — Watch: A Service Intake in Action

Slide-ID: SLD_CC00_015
Template-ID: video-scenario
Slide-Title: Watch: A Service Intake in Action
Video-File: face_intake_scenario_CC00.mp4
>> On slide load → SLD_CC00_015_INTRO.mp3
Voiceover-INTRO: Watch this service intake conversation and look for how the advisor applies — or misses — each step of the FACE framework. Pay attention to the moments where the conversation either builds trust or starts to lose it.
Voiceover-Summary: The quality of the intake conversation shapes everything that follows — the customer's expectations, their willingness to approve additional work, and whether they feel confident leaving their vehicle. The FACE framework isn't a script. It's a structure for giving every customer the experience they're already expecting from Porsche.
Caption-Text: Watch and look for how the advisor applies the FACE framework.
Status: Draft
Notes: video-scenario chosen — scenario demonstrates FACE framework application better than text alone. Reference implementation: SLD_CC03_008.html.
```

### `bar-chart-modal`

**Status:** Emerging — reference implementation: `SLD_CC03_006.html`
**Use when:** Presenting data broken into 3–4 named categories where each category needs an expanded explanation. Best for statistics that benefit from both a visual proportion AND detailed context per segment.
**Avoid when:** More than 4 categories (layout breaks) or the categories don't need expanded detail (use `content-stat` instead).

**What the learner sees:**
Photo panel on the left. Right panel with animated bar chart — each bar fills to its percentage value on load. Clicking a bar opens a modal with an icon, percentage, label, and bullet explanation. All bars must be clicked before Next unlocks. Bars are locked until INTRO VO ends.

**Bar label format:** PascalCase, no spaces — `BodyLanguage`, `ToneOfVoice`, `Words`

**Required fields:**

| Field | Format | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `Slide-Title` | Section heading | |
| `On-Screen-Text` | Brief intro above chart | Context for the data |
| `Voiceover-INTRO` | 3–4 sentences | Introduce the data; tell learner to click each bar |
| `Voiceover-CLICK-Label` | One per bar, 2–4 sentences | Plays when modal opens. Label = category name in PascalCase |
| `Image-File` | `descriptive_name_CCxx.webp` | Left photo panel image |
| `Caption-Text` | ≤120 chars | First sentence of INTRO VO |

**In `Notes` field:** Always specify bar values so the developer knows what percentages to set in the HTML.
Example: `Bar values: BodyLanguage=55%, ToneOfVoice=38%, Words=7%`

**Audio file naming:** `{SLIDE_ID}_CLICK_{Label}.mp3`

**Interaction model:**
- Bars locked until INTRO VO ends.
- Bar click → modal opens + CLICK audio plays.
- Next locked until all bars visited.

**Example:**
```
## Slide 07 — How Communication Really Works

Slide-ID: SLD_CC00_007
Template-ID: bar-chart-modal
Slide-Title: How Communication Really Works
On-Screen-Text: Research shows that how we say something matters far more than what we say.
Image-File: communication_research_CC00.webp
>> On slide load → SLD_CC00_007_INTRO.mp3
Voiceover-INTRO: Here's a striking breakdown of how communication actually works. Most people assume the words carry the message — but the data tells a very different story. Click each bar to understand what that channel really means in a service conversation.
Caption-Text: Research shows that how we say something matters far more than what we say.
>> User clicks BodyLanguage bar → SLD_CC00_007_CLICK_BodyLanguage.mp3
Voiceover-CLICK-BodyLanguage: Body language accounts for fifty-five percent of how a message is received. Every posture choice, every glance at a screen instead of the customer, every crossed arm — it's all being read in real time. Before you've said a single thing, your body language has already told the customer whether this is going to be a good experience.
>> User clicks ToneOfVoice bar → SLD_CC00_007_CLICK_ToneOfVoice.mp3
Voiceover-CLICK-ToneOfVoice: Tone of voice carries thirty-eight percent of the communication signal — pace, warmth, and confidence in how you speak. Customers who can't evaluate the technical side of what you're telling them listen closely to how you sound. Confidence in your voice builds confidence in your recommendation.
>> User clicks Words bar → SLD_CC00_007_CLICK_Words.mp3
Voiceover-CLICK-Words: Words account for just seven percent of how a message is received. That doesn't mean they don't matter — it means they carry less weight than most people assume. Where word choice matters most is ownership and precision: "I'll take care of that" versus "someone will look into it" signals entirely different levels of accountability.
Status: Draft
Notes: bar-chart-modal chosen — 55/38/7 communication breakdown is visual data that benefits from chart + modal detail. Bar values: BodyLanguage=55%, ToneOfVoice=38%, Words=7%. Reference implementation: SLD_CC03_006.html.
